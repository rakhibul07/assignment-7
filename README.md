2.Managing state in my React assignment using useState, useEffect and props is a fundamental concept. These hooks allow you to work with state and side effects in functional components. 

• useState:  Use useState to declare and manage local component state variables. These variables can hold data that can change over time and trigger re-renders when updated.

• useEffect: Use useEffect to perform side effects in my components. I can use it to run code after rendering, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM. It's often used to handle side effects related to state changes.

• Props: Props are data passed from a parent component to a child component.I can use props to pass data down the component tree and make my components more reusable and dynamic.
